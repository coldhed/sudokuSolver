only one solver class

when state changes to 'play':   DONE
    start a thread which looks solutions in that current setup:
        wait until it receives a first solution in order to make sure its solvable 

    store solutions in the solver class (outside the thread)
    
    when it finishes looking solutions:
        notify solver class
        end

when analysing a move: DONE

    ONLY DO THIS IF THERE ARE MORE THAN ONE SOLUTIONS

    look for a setup where that is the move:
        if found then eliminate other incompatible solutions. set self.map to current setup

        if not found:
            if thread has finished looking for solutions its a wrong move
            else if thread has not finished looking for solutions then: 
                if possible pause the other thread

                look if that setup has a solution:
                    if it does then eliminate other incompatible solutions. set self.map to current setup
                    if it doesn't then it's incorrect

                resume the other thread

solver has to:
 - manage the searcher thread and store the answers: DONE
    - evaluate if a set-up is solvable DONE

    - with the answers from the searcher thread evaluate a solution: DONE
        - if necessary delete incompatible solutions with current set up DONE

 - evaluate a single solution DONE
 - if solve button is clicked then manage the show_solve thread 
    - stop the searcher thread

searcher thread has to:
 - create a possibilities map   DONE | it's actually sent by the solver object
 - look for solutions using the possible numbers in each square | DONE
 - send solutions whenever it founds one | DONE
 - notify when it ends | DONE

 show_solve thread has to:  TODO / create a showing_solve state
 - follow the normal solve process of a solve:
    - sleep or wait each time a number is changed in the puzzle
    - notify solver in which step it is (contraint propagation / DFS)



IF SHOW THREAD DOESN'T GIVE FULL STATUS IT MIGHT BE THAT THE CHANNEL IS FULL AND IT DIDNT PULL THE LAST ONE
